Working on the OnlyGlobal Java application was both challenging and rewarding. One of the main difficulties I faced was understanding how to manage and structure the different message states (sent, disregarded, stored) and ensuring they were handled properly within the GUI. Integrating multiple classes to communicate smoothly took some trial and error, especially when trying to make sure that all arrays updated in real time.

Another challenge was figuring out how to preserve data between sessions. I originally attempted to save messages to a JSON file, but getting them to load correctly when reopening the app required more debugging than expected. I also struggled with the modal behavior of the report page, where it would open behind the main window or become unresponsive, but I eventually figured out how to implement it as a proper JDialog.

Despite these obstacles, there were many parts of the project I genuinely enjoyed. I liked customizing the GUI and giving each button a clear function with icons and labels—it made the app feel more polished and user-friendly. I also enjoyed working with hash generation and message validation, which added a practical security-like layer to the app. Testing the different features like searching by ID or deleting by hash was surprisingly fun once everything was working properly.

Overall, I learned a lot about Java Swing, data structures, and object-oriented programming. The process pushed me to be more patient and creative with solving UI and logic issues, and I’m proud of how the final product came together.
